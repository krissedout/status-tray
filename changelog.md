# Changelog

All notable changes to Status Tray will be documented in this file.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Inline icon limit can now be set as low as `0`, collapsing every tray item into the overflow menu (Windows-style). Previously the minimum was `1`, which always forced at least one icon to stay inline. Thanks to [@krissedout](https://github.com/krissedout) for the suggestion and patch.

## [1.9] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Menu items now render `icon-name` and `icon-data` properties from the DBusMenu specification. Apps that publish per-item icons (e.g. those using libdbusmenu-glib/qt with explicit icon properties) will see them rendered next to each menu entry, including on submenu headers. `icon-data` is decoded as PNG bytes via `Gio.BytesIcon`; `icon-name` is resolved through the system icon theme.

### Fixed
- Overflow menu rows now respect the global Icon Style setting and per-app icon effect overrides (desaturation, brightness/contrast, tint). Previously the rows mirrored only the raw icon source, so an app set to symbolic in the panel would still render full-colour in the overflow popup. `_applySymbolicStyle` now accepts a target icon and is invoked on each row's `St.Icon` after the source is mirrored, reusing the same effect pipeline as the panel.
- Fixed overflow menu icons disappearing and randomly re-appearing for pixmap-backed apps (Electron/Flatpak and `IconPixmap`-fallback clients). Menu rows now mirror the tray icon's `Clutter.Content` when `gicon` and `icon_name` are both null, and reset every potential icon source before each refresh so switching branches (e.g. pixmap → named) no longer leaves stale state behind. Thanks to [@W1zardK1ng](https://github.com/W1zardK1ng) for the report.
- Fixed the most recently registered app's overflow row remaining stuck on the loading placeholder until the next app registered. The initial async icon load wasn't emitting `display-changed`, so the overflow button never refreshed; the signal is now emitted from every icon-style update path.
- Fixed duplicate tray icons for apps like Cloudflare's `warp-taskbar` that register via the spec-canonical `org.kde.StatusNotifierItem-PID-ID` well-known name. The watcher's bus-address discriminator regex now accepts hyphens (per the D-Bus name grammar), so both the proactive scan and `RegisterStatusNotifierItem` resolve to the same unique connection name and the existing dedup catches the second registration. Thanks to [@rncoll7](https://github.com/rncoll7) for the report and fix.

## [1.8] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- Fixed tray icons going blank for apps whose `IconName` resolves to a FreeDesktop category outside the previously-searched set (e.g. `folder-remote-symbolic` in `places/`). The icon theme search now covers `places`, `mimetypes`, `emotes`, `categories`, `emblems`, `ui`, and the `applications` alias in addition to the existing categories.
- Fixed the GTK fall-through path silently rendering nothing when the manual theme walk missed an icon. The fall-through now resolves via `St.IconTheme.lookup_icon` and routes through the working `gicon` path; the bare `set_icon_name` call is now a true last resort.
- Fixed Ubuntu's update-notifier icons (and other SNI clients that sit at `Status='Passive'` between events) being shown in the tray. Per the StatusNotifierItem spec, Passive items are now hidden until the app transitions to Active or NeedsAttention. Overflow slot accounting ignores Passive items so they don't push real icons into the overflow popup.

## [1.7] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Optional panel overflow. When enabled from preferences, any tray icons beyond a user-chosen inline limit collapse into a single overflow button at the right end of the tray. Each collapsed app is accessible as an inline submenu that lazily loads the app's own menu on first open, with live updates to the row's icon and title. The overflow button ships its own symbolic and full-colour glyphs that track the global Icon Style setting. Disabled by default.

### Changed
- Icon customization dialog no longer closes when an icon is picked (grid, "Choose File...", or "Reset to Default"). The dialog stays open so fallback/lock/title-alias switches remain reachable in the same visit; dismiss via the titlebar close button when finished. Selections continue to save to GSettings as they are made.
- Preferences About row now uses the bundled Status Tray icon instead of the generic `preferences-system-symbolic` glyph.

## [1.6] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Opt-in "Match by App Name" toggle in icon customization for apps (e.g. Karing) that randomize their SNI Id on every launch. When enabled, per-app settings are keyed by the app's display name instead of the unstable process-derived ID, so custom icons and other preferences persist across app restarts. Thanks to [@paveleremin](https://github.com/paveleremin) for the report.

### Changed
- Tightened horizontal padding on tray icons so multiple icons group compactly, matching the density of the native GNOME panel icons and the AppIndicator extension. Thanks to [@paveleremin](https://github.com/paveleremin) for the suggestion.

### Fixed
- Title-alias resolution now re-runs when an app's `Title` or `ToolTip` properties arrive after the initial D-Bus proxy init (common for Electron-style apps). Previously, apps that populated `Title` slightly late would keep their unstable SNI Id as the settings key after a restart until the extension itself was reloaded.
- Per-app settings migration when the appId changes now covers all keyed settings (icon overrides, icon effect overrides, fallback list, lock list) instead of only `app-order` and `disabled-apps`.
- Effect Settings dialog preview now matches the actual tray icon. The preview's contrast formula now uses Clutter's `tan((c+1)·π/4)` mapping instead of treating the slider value as a direct multiplier, and the tint formula uses luminance weights to match `Clutter.ColorizeEffect`. Symbolic icons also correctly skip desaturation/brightness/contrast in the preview, matching tray behaviour.
- Icon picker's "Current Icon" preview now shows the actual icon the app is displaying (including pixmap-backed icons from Electron/Flatpak apps) instead of falling back to a generic placeholder when the icon name can't be looked up in the GTK theme.

### Changed
- Icon theme inheritance is now resolved asynchronously at startup instead of via synchronous file reads, in line with GNOME extension review guidelines.
- Tray item menu and D-Bus proxy signals are now explicitly disconnected, and the watcher's exported D-Bus object reference released, on disable. Improves hygiene around suspend/resume and re-enable cycles.

## [1.5] - 2026-03-18

### Changed
- Confirmed GNOME 50 compatibility and updated manifest.

## [1.4] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- Fixed panel item identifiers containing ephemeral D-Bus bus names (e.g. `StatusTray-:1.770/org/ayatana/NotificationItem/steam`), causing extensions like Top Bar Organizer to lose saved icon positions on every app restart or reboot. Panel items now use stable app-derived identifiers (e.g. `StatusTray-steam`).
- Fixed icon overrides lost after suspend/resume for non-Flatpak Electron apps (e.g. Element). Dynamic ToolTip titles like "Element | Room Name" are now normalized to a stable base name so overrides persist across state changes. Thanks to [@3Lord3](https://github.com/3Lord3) for the report.

## [1.3] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- "Ignore App Status Icons" option for icon overrides. When enabled, the chosen icon stays in place regardless of status changes from the app (e.g. Surfshark connected/disconnected, Firewall Applet zone changes). Thanks to [@somePaulo](https://github.com/somePaulo) for the suggestion.
- Menu checkmark and radio button support. Toggle states in app menus are now rendered correctly. Thanks to [@somePaulo](https://github.com/somePaulo) for the report.

### Fixed
- Fixed disabled apps reappearing after logout/reboot due to async app ID resolution. Thanks to [@noahajac](https://github.com/noahajac) for the contribution.
- Fixed app order and enable status not persisting in preferences when app IDs resolve asynchronously. Thanks to [@noahajac](https://github.com/noahajac) for the contribution.
- Fixed symbolic icon overrides rendering invisible (black on black) instead of being recoloured to match the panel theme. Thanks to [@somePaulo](https://github.com/somePaulo) for the report.
- Fixed changing an icon override for one app corrupting icons of other apps (especially Electron/Flatpak apps) due to stale IconThemePath lookups.
- Fixed app ID resolution using volatile tooltip text instead of stable SNI Id, causing icon overrides to not persist across sessions for apps like Nextcloud and Firewall Applet.
- Fixed preferences dialog being too small for the new options.
- Fixed app subtitle in preferences overflowing with long tooltip text; now truncated to one line.
- Fixed old icon widget not being destroyed when replacing with an override, leaking Clutter effects.
- Deduplicated menu toggle ornament code into shared helper.

## [1.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Fixed icons going blank when an app updates its icon to a standard system icon name. The icon theme search now correctly follows theme inheritance and covers all icon categories.

## [1.1] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- "Use as Fallback Only" option for icon overrides. When enabled, the custom icon is only used when the app sends a low-quality pixbuf or no icon at all — the app's own named icon is preserved when available. Useful for apps like NextCloud that normally provide good icons but occasionally fall back to ugly pixbufs.
- Flatpak icon resilience: when a Flatpak app's temporary `IconThemePath` is unavailable, the extension now tries the Flatpak app ID (e.g. `org.ferdium.Ferdium`) as a fallback icon name. Also added `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/icons` to the icon theme search paths so Flatpak-exported icons are discoverable.

### Fixed
- Fixed icon tint effect not applying on GNOME 48+.
- Fixed stale/broken tray icons after suspend/resume. The extension now runs a health check on startup that detects and removes ghost icons left behind by apps (especially Flatpak apps) that didn't survive sleep properly.
- Fixed certain icons having a '...' icon background. 

## [1.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- Initial release completed
